I loved Senran Kagura on the 3 DS so I figured this could be similar in terms of gameplay.This game just rocks!The attention to detail and fanservice is spot on.The gameplay is perfect if you just want to have some fun for short bursts of time.Each battle takes around 10 - 20 minutes and it never gets boring as new missions and objectives constantly pop up.  Did I mention the fanservice ? !Like how Link puts away his sword in the opening cinematic just like in the reveal trailer of what would become Twilight Princess.  Get this game! ",
